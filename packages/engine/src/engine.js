 * hop count.  Maximum search depth is 6 hops; returns `found: false` if no
 * path is found within that limit.
 *
 * Path types:
 *   • 0 hops — termA and termB share the exact same universal concept

// CKG = Compiled Knowledge Graph (see GKB, KNOWLEDGE section).
// These operations let the Rosetta protocol grow indefinitely without
// architectural redesign. Each treats lexicons as compiled objects and
// universal concepts as the cross-object symbol table.
//
//   compile-target: a lexicon (terms anchored to symtab)
//   linker:         composeLexicon
//   undef-symbol:   discoverGaps
//   semantic-diff:  lexiconSimilarity
//   symtab-extend:  registerUniversal
//   namegen:        generateGlyph
//
// Trinity: CKB (storage) / CKA (architecture) / CKG (meaning-layer).
// Growth by accretion, not redesign. The protocol describes itself in
// its own object format — see the `rosetta` lexicon in LEXICONS above.
// ============
